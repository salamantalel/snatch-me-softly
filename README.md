 #  Snatch Me Softly – Daily Affirmation App by Sal

Hi love   
This is a soft, simple, one-tab app that I made for myself — and for anyone who just needs to breathe and remember who the hell they are. It’s a daily affirmation tool. It’s cute. It’s coded with love. It’s me.

Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. API handled with JSON Server.  
Styled in soft pink and cream because healing doesn’t have to be boring. ✨

##  What This App Does

- **Get an instant affirmation** that lifts you up when the world feels heavy.
- **Search affirmations** that match a word or vibe you’re feeling (like “storm” or “worthy”).
- **Write your own affirmation** — type it, click the button, and it shows up like a tiny hug.
- All on **one tab**. No reloads. Just click and vibe.
- It’s all done using **JavaScript DOM**, **array methods**, and **live interactions**.

##  Tech & Tools I Used

- `HTML` – for structure
- `Tailwind CSS` – for styling (I chose this because I like the control)
- `JavaScript` – for all the interactivity (event listeners, filtering, randomization)
- `JSON Server` – to simulate a real backend API
- `Git + GitHub` – for version control and deployment

##  How the Features Work (In My Words)

- The "Give Me Strength" button picks a random affirmation from my API.
- The search input filters affirmations live as you type, using `filter()` and `map()`.
- You can write your own affirmation — but it checks if you typed something first. If you didn’t, it’ll kindly say “please write something.” 
- When you add yours, it sends a POST request to my JSON server and then shows it right away.
- I also used comments in my code — over 20 of them — so anyone reading it can follow along with the logic like they’re reading my thoughts.

##  My Favorite Thing About This Project

I made this while learning. While tired. While in class. While still figuring out my life.  
But I also made it for every version of me who just needed a gentle reminder that softness is not weakness. I wanted to build something I would actually *use*. Something I would actually *open*. And I did.

##  Things I Practiced in This Project

- How to use `fetch()` to GET and POST data from a fake API
- DOM manipulation: changing content, filtering lists, capturing user input
- Handling errors without crashing the vibe
- Writing code comments that *actually explain what’s happening*
- Working with Tailwind CSS to keep the aesthetic clean and soft
- Debugging with the console 
- Patience 🙃
